# An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R 🦑👩🏻‍💻


This is a collection of notebooks to cover the applied exercises of the above book

 * Most of these notebooks are associated with my [Kaggle Codes](https://www.kaggle.com/code/uvinir)
 * I have attached the link to the respective Kaggle notebook at the begining of each code
 * Most of the datasets used are availabe on Kaggle
 * All the unavailable datasets are uploaded to Kaggle account (public access)/ uploaded to this repo
 * Branches are based on the chapters of the reference book, thus each branch is to represent answers for Applied Questions of the particular chapter 
 
```
I am still reading on applyications of ML using R!!! 
So the repository will be updated frequently with my new learnings
